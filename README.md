**My portfolio site**

While working on my website, I’ve played with Git, Github, Github Pages, Jekyll, Markdown, Sass, Codekit, advanced CSS, DNS servers, CNAMES….  Whew!  No wonder I’m blown away.  I went way over my head, but everyone keeps saying they learn something new when they take on new projects.  When I go in, I go in all the way!

This site owes heavily to learning with Travis Neilson / Dev Tips guy.  I feel like I learn from 0 to 180 when I'm watching and learning from his video tutorials.  He's incredibly driven, and imaginative.

As for me, I just love doing this.  I'm always excited for what's next to come out, and try my best to keep up with what's current.  I owe so much to web designers, developers & podcasters (and my parents).  What a long journey to get to this point, but it's worth it.  I've really learned so much from the  generous developer's community in Balitmore. And it just gets better every day.

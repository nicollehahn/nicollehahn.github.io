This was a site we worked on at Betamore Academy. The site was designed & developed by Ben Plum.
Apps used were Gridlock, Normalize, and Grunt. We created the desktop version of the website, then we refactored it to produce a responsive design.

Much coffee was imbibed whilst working on this project.

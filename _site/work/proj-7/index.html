<p>I created this channel as a space for a group of great ladies I met while taking an intro to Ruby class.  I created this as a safe space for us to share the many aspects in the dev community, from asking questions, to upcoming events, all the way down to “pain &amp; frustration” – a channel devoted to those agonizing moments found in design and development!</p>

<p>Fun fact: It was initially called “Ruby Girls” but we found we wore other hats as well.  The name was changed to Devgrrls but personally I’d be happy calling it BestLadiesEver.  <br />
	I’m currently figuring out the new name when our first boy joins the group.</p>

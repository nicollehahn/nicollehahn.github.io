<p>This was a site we worked on at Betamore Academy. The site was designed &amp; developed by Ben Plum.
Apps used were Gridlock &amp; Normalize, Grunt. We created the website, and then we refactored it to produce a responsive design.</p>

<p>Much coffee was imbibed whilst working on this project.</p>

Heads Will Spin

They don't tell you when you get into Web Development that many times you will feel as if things fly right over your head, or after much learning and coding, your head will be left spinning. 

I wish I could say that the feeling stops which it does but ....... I think you enjoy feeling that way so you seek out more ways to experience it. Why else would I decide to do Rails when I barely have Ruby down?  Did I mention while pursuing the above I am in a responsive web design & development class?  Did I mention Jekyll?

(Gulp)
